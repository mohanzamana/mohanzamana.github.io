    <section><p>Many years ago (some say before the
first copy was published) an
unauthorised copy of 1001 Nights
was found in Herat. It traveled
west through the desert.
A holy man washed it with
zam zam water. It was then lost,
buried under the great dunes.
When the winds came howling
in the great storm
(during the life of Ibn Sina),
it resurfaced. A great philosopher
of the future read it.
We do not know if this
copy matched the authorised
copy of 1001 Nights.
Somewhere near the middle
of the book Scheherazade starts
narrating a story.
This story begins at the first
story of the book.
Within this story Scheherazade
reaches where she is and
starts narrating a story.
Some say she never stopped narrating.
Some say our future philosopher
never stopped reading.</p>
